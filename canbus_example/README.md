# CAN-bus example application

# How it works
Two micropython boards are connected via a CAN bus.

## Sender
- Pressing the *USER*-button will send `b'on'` to the CAN-id `123`.
- Releasing the *USER*-button will send `b'off'` to the CAN-id `123`.

```
>>> import canbus_sender
Press Switch to send CAN-telegrams, press <ctrl-c> to abort.
sending b'on' to Id 123
sending b'off' to Id 123
sending b'on' to Id 123
```

## Receiver
- Waits for CAN-telegrams for CAN-ids `122`, `123`, `124` and `125`.
- When a CAN-telegram arrives it switches the LED *on* if the telegram is `b'on'`.

```
>>> import canbus_receiver_interrupt
Now listening on these CAN-id's:  (122, 123, 124, 125)
>>> received: b'on'
received: b'off'
received: b'on'
```
Note, that there is a `>>>` before `received: b'on'`. This indicates, that `import canbus_receiver_interrupt` returned and the command prompt is active again. But the interrupt handler is still active in the backgroud.

# Implementation
It is about the simplest program to demonstrate CAN-bus communication.

There are two implementations of the receiver:
 - `canbus_receiver_polling.py` is polling in the main-loop.
 - `canbus_receiver_interrupt.py` gives the control back to the command prompt but a interrupts service is called whenever a CAN-telegram arrives.

# Baud-Rate-Table
The settings for the baudrates may be evaluated by the following script.
**Note that the values are only valid for STM32F4 processors running on 168MHz.**
```

# Schematic
You need two external CAN-transceivers (one for the sender and one for the receiver board). I used [SN65HVD230 from TI](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/sn65hvd230.pdf).
